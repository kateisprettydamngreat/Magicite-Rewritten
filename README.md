# Magicite-Rewritten

Magicite rewritten is a fan-led overhaul of Magicite in it's entirety. Primary goals are rewriting the codebase, moving to a modern unity version, adding cloud saves, and more! Additionally, a big goal is implementing steam's multiplayer in order to make playing with friends a viable option. Some additional, but more lofty ambitions would be adding more inherent mod support, rebalancing the game, and even adding new content.
